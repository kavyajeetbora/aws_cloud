## What is EC2?

Elastic Compute Cloud - Provides scalable virtual machines in the AWS cloud, allowing us to run application and services with flexible compute capacity. if offers variety of instance types based on the requirements.

## Types of EC2 instaces

There are different types of EC2 instances based on the requirements. For example:

Here are the different types of instances of EC2:

You can check the different types of instances and their attributes like per hour cost, RAM etc on this page:

## Security Groups

Security groups acts as a virual firewalls of the EC2 instance to control the inbound and outbound traffic.

1. Inbound and Outbound rules: Inbound rules are to control who can reach the EC2 instance. Outbound is to control the traffic going outside of the instance.

Security groups helps to ensure that only desired traffic can access your instances, enhanching the security of our application.

## Connecting the AWS EC2 instance remotely

We will use SSH for connecting to an EC2 instance from another device. What is SSH ?

Secure Shell Connect, which allows to remotely connect the AWS EC2 Instance. This will allow us to control the remote machine/server all using the local command line in the remote device.

For connecting to the server via ssh, we need a security key to authenticate the device. Usually it is a `.pem` file

Here are the steps to connect to the EC2 instance:

1. [Create a Security key pair for your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html)

2. Download the security `.pem` file and store it

3. Open AWS CLI in your local system and change directory to where the .pem file is saved:

```
cd '\directory\folder'
```

4. Then we need to change the permissions, for that type:

```
chmod 0400 ec2tutorial.pem
```

5. Then to connect to the remote server:

```
ssh -i ec2tutorial.pem ec2-user@43.204.218.216
```

Here the `ec2-user` id is already setup by the AWS Linux OS when initiating the AWS EC2 instance

Now after this you can acess the aws EC2 machine from your local machine remotely.

## EC2 Instance Role

Once the EC2 is running and remote connection set up is running, now we can connect the other AWS services like IAM to this EC2 instance. It can be setup using the aws cli but the recommended way is to setup using AWS console.

Creating a new role in the AWS console is more secured and scalable

## EC2 purchasing options

Amazon EC2 offers several purchasing options to help you optimize costs and meet your specific needs:

1. **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. Ideal for short-term, irregular workloads².
2. **Savings Plans**: Commit to a consistent amount of usage (in USD per hour) for 1 or 3 years to reduce costs¹.
3. **Reserved Instances**: Commit to a specific instance configuration for 1 or 3 years to receive a significant discount¹.
4. **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at reduced rates. Suitable for flexible workloads that can handle interruptions¹.
5. **Dedicated Hosts**: Pay for a physical server fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to use your existing software licenses¹.
6. **Dedicated Instances**: Run instances on single-tenant hardware, providing physical isolation from other AWS accounts¹.
7. **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve capacity in a specific Availability Zone for any duration¹.

Each option has its own advantages depending on your workload requirements and budget.
