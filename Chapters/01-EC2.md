## What is EC2?

Elastic Compute Cloud - Provides scalable virtual machines in the AWS cloud, allowing us to run application and services with flexible compute capacity. if offers variety of instance types based on the requirements.

## Types of EC2 instaces

There are different types of EC2 instances based on the requirements. For example:

You can check the different types of instances and their attributes like per hour cost, RAM etc on this page:

## Security Groups

Security groups acts as a virual firewalls of the EC2 instance to control the inbound and outbound traffic.

1. Inbound and Outbound rules: Inbound rules are to control who can reach the EC2 instance. Outbound is to control the traffic going outside of the instance.

Security groups helps to ensure that only desired traffic can access your instances, enhanching the security of our application.

## Connecting the AWS EC2 instance remotely

We will use SSH for connecting to an EC2 instance from another device. What is SSH ?

Secure Shell Connect, which allows to remotely connect the AWS EC2 Instance. This will allow us to control the remote machine/server all using the local command line in the remote device.

For connecting to the server via ssh, we need a security key to authenticate the device. Usually it is a `.pem` file
